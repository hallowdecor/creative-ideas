N95s have a tighter fit to your face than cloth masks and are made with a special material designed to block 95% of harmful particles. The cdc�s official guidelines suggest that n95 masks are the most effective, with kn95 masks coming in at a close second and cloth face masks providing the least. These standards are generally considered to be less stringent than those enforced by niosh, but the cdc does keep a whitelist of manufacturers whose kn95 masks passed an n95 qualification test. Besides the n95 being made to meet us standards and the kn95 being made to meet chinese standards, data obtained from the performance testing of both masks show that there is a lower pressure drop on inhalation and exhalation for the n95 facemask.
