<p>The career itself is peanuts, your sim earns $5,580 a week, but, similar to the painter, only works six hours a day for two days a week.

These careers allow you to actually follow your sims to work and perform interactions throughout the work day with them. Modeling/photographer would make use of the photo object that so far is fairly useless.</p>
